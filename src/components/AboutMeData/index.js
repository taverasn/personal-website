        Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a dedicated Game Developer with a solid
        foundation in engineering, and I'm thrilled to share my journey with
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bring three years of professional engineering experience to the table,
        during which I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of
        projects, including websites, games, and Windows applications. This
        hands-on experience has been invaluable in shaping my skills and
        perspective as a developer.

        My coding journey took an exciting turn when I embarked on a coding boot
        camp in software engineering, which I completed from September 2020 to
        March 2021. During this intensive program, I dove deep into the world of
        coding, mastering JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, React, Django, Trello,
        PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. This experience has equipped me with a
        versatile skill set that allows me to approach projects from various
        angles.

        I'm also in the final stretch of my Bachelor's in Game Development, a
        journey that began in June 2021 and will culminate in December 2023.
        Throughout my academic career, I've had the privilege of working on a
        wide range of projects, both solo and in collaboration with talented
        peers. In group settings, I often took on leadership roles, leveraging
        my skills to guide and inspire my teammates. I'm proud of my ability to
        review and optimize code, as well as my knack for tackling challenges
        with minimal guidance. Constructive criticism has been a vital part of
        my growth, and I eagerly embrace opportunities for learning and
        improvement.

        My project portfolio reflects my versatility and dedication. Whether
        it's crafting websites, developing Windows applications, or creating
        immersive games, I thrive on bringing creative visions to life through
        code. Currently, I'm actively seeking an exciting role in Game
        Development. I'm enthusiastic about collaborating with like-minded
        professionals, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the gaming
        industry, and contributing my skills and passion to innovative projects.
